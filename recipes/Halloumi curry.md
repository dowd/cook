10. Cut into 3 cm chunks courgettes, onions, cut into wedges, and peppers, seeds removed and cut
    into 3 cm pieces. Put all of the vegetables on a large baking tray. Drizzle over the olive oil and
    sprinkle with the paprika. Season with salt and pepper and toss well to coat. Roast for 45 minutes,
    turning the vegetables halfway through roasting, or until softened and cooked through. Set aside.

11. To make the curry, heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil over a high heat in a large, deep frying pan.
    Add the halloumi cubes. Cook for 5–10 minutes until golden all over. Carefully remove from the pan
    and set aside.
    [vegetable oil: 1 tbsp]
12. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining vegetable oil to the pan along with the garlic,
    curry powder and half of the roast vegetables (set aside the remaining roast vegetables for another
    recipe in this meal plan). Cook for 3–4 minutes, stirring often, until the garlic has just softened.

13. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir for a further 2–3 minutes until everything is
    coated. Add the coconut milk and salt and stir well. Put the lid on, turn the heat down to low and
    cook for 5 minutes until the sauce is thickened. Return the halloumi to the pan and cook for a
    further 5 minutes until heated through. Serve immediately with the rice.
