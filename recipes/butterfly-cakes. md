Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.

Put all the ingredients: @baking spread{100%g}, @caster sugar{100%g}, @large free-range eggs{2}, @self-raising flour{100%g}, @baking powder{1%level tsp}, @orange{1}(grated zest only), and @orange curd{3%tbsp} into a #large bowl{} and beat well for ~{2-3%minutes}, or until the mixture is well-blended and smooth. Fill each paper case with about @cake mixture{35%g}.

Bake in the preheated oven for ~{15-20%minutes}, or until the cakes are well risen and golden-brown. Lift the paper cases out of the bun tin and cool the cakes on a wire rack.

When cool, cut a disc from the top of each cake leaving a little gap around the edge and cut this slice in half. Spoon @orange curd{1/2%teaspoon} in each.

To make the icing, beat @soft butter{50%g} and @sifted icing sugar{100%g} together until well blended. Pipe or spoon a swirl of buttercream on top of the orange curd and place the half slices of cake on top to resemble butterfly wings. Dust the cakes with @icing sugar{to dust} to finish.
